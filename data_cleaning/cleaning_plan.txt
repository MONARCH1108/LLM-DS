Step 1: Handle Missing Values
Affected columns: `track_name`, `album_name`
Condition: Skip if missing values are confirmed to be valid 'no data' indicators and downstream processes can handle them without issue.
Action: For `track_name` and `album_name`, impute with a 'UNKNOWN' placeholder or drop rows if the percentage of missing values is very low and these specific rows are not critical. Prioritize imputation to preserve row count.
Severity: Medium

Step 2: Address Outliers
Affected columns: `popularity`, `stream_count`, `explicit`
Condition: Skip if outliers are determined to be genuine, valuable data points representing true extreme events in the dataset.
Action: For `stream_count` and `explicit` (severe outliers), investigate their origin. Consider capping values (winsorization) or transforming them to reduce their influence. For `explicit`, validate if the outlier values indicate incorrect encoding or data entry errors beyond its expected range (e.g., 0/1). For `popularity`, evaluate the impact and decide if a similar capping or transformation is beneficial.
Severity: High

Step 3: Handle Data Skewness
Affected columns: `stream_count`
Condition: Skip if downstream models or analytical methods are robust to skewed distributions or if the skewed nature of the data is intentionally preserved.
Action: Apply appropriate mathematical transformations (e.g., logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox transformation) to `stream_count` to reduce its skewness and achieve a more symmetric distribution.
Severity: Medium

Step 4: Manage High Cardinality Categorical Features
Affected columns: `track_name`, `artist_name`, `album_name`, `release_date`
Condition: Skip if these features are not intended for use in models requiring numerical encoding, or if the system can efficiently handle high-dimensional sparse representations. `track_id` is a unique identifier and typically not encoded.
Action: For `track_name`, `artist_name`, `album_name`, consider grouping rare categories, frequency encoding, or using feature hashing if direct categorical encoding is too memory-intensive or creates too many features. For `release_date`, extract relevant temporal features like year, month, or age of track, then consider dropping the original column or converting it to an appropriate date-time object.
