Step 1: Handle missing values
Affected columns: track_name, album_name
Condition: Skip if no missing values are found in these columns.
Action: Impute with a suitable placeholder like 'Unknown' or the mode, or remove rows if the proportion is negligible and permitted.
Severity: Medium

Step 2: Address severe outliers
Affected columns: stream_count, explicit
Condition: Skip if no severe outliers are detected in these columns.
Action: Investigate the nature of severe outliers and apply robust treatment methods such as capping/flooring or data correction.
Severity: High

Step 3: Address non-severe outliers
Affected columns: popularity
Condition: Skip if no outliers are detected in this column.
Action: Investigate the distribution and apply appropriate outlier treatment, such as Winsorization or transformation.
Severity: Medium

Step 4: Correct data skewness
Affected columns: stream_count
Condition: Skip if the column's distribution is no longer highly skewed.
Action: Apply a suitable data transformation (e.g., logarithmic, square root, Box-Cox) to reduce skewness.
Severity: Medium

Step 5: Manage high cardinality features
Affected columns: track_id, track_name, artist_name, album_name, release_date
Condition: Skip if cardinality is no longer an issue for the intended use case.
Action: For `track_id`, verify uniqueness. For other high cardinality columns, evaluate and apply appropriate encoding strategies based on downstream model requirements or group infrequent categories.
Severity: Medium

Overall cleaning complexity: High
